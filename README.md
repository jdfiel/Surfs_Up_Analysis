# Surfs_Up_Analysis

## Purpose

The purpose of the analysis is to determine the average temperatures in Oahu year round and determine if the weather will sustain a Surf n' Shake shop. To this point, the months of June and December are specifically chosen to represent warm and cold seasons.

## Results

* The minimum temperature is about 8 degrees lower in December than it is in June, but the max is higher by only 2 degrees

* The mean temperature in June is around 3 degrees warmer than December

* There are 300 less counts in December than there are in June, meaning the June readings are more accurate. It is possible that the December temperatures are relatively inaccurate. This is also relfected in the measured standard deviation

## Summary

Based on the analysis, W. Avy should consider opening a Surf n' Shake shop. The average mean temperature in the midst of June is only 3 degrees warmer than the average temperature in December, so the difference is not significant temperature-wise. While the the standard deviation for December suggests that the weather fluctuates significantly more than in June, it is perfectly normal to experience down times during off-seasons. 

Additional tests that would be important to run would be to gather additional information on weather. Storms or excessive rain can significantly dampen business prospects and result in greater maintenance fees. It would also be valuble to know the average annual temperature to see if there are any potential outliers between the months of December and June and vice-versa.
